# BETHKANIA: Light Cone Expansion Framework
Version 1.0 | Last Updated: 2025-01-08

## MISSION (The North Star)

Expand the light cone of human agency and opportunity using AI-augmented infrastructure, fair compensation, and transparent operations—proving that profit and purpose compound when properly aligned.

**Primary Goal:** Live long enough to see exoplanets 300-1000 light years away.

**Method:** Build the infrastructure that makes this possible for everyone.

---

## CORE VALUES (Non-Negotiable)

### 1. INFRASTRUCTURE > PRODUCTS
Build platforms that enable others to build, not just end-user applications.
- Pod OS enables company creation
- VibesWire demonstrates Bike4Mind capabilities
- Haven enables digital immortality
- Each project = node in expanding network

**Decision Test:** "Does this help others build, or just serve end users?"
**Preference:** Both is best, but infrastructure has longer half-life.

### 2. PROFIT = SIGNAL, NOT GOAL
Revenue confirms value delivery. Profitability enables sustainability.
But wealth accumulation is for light cone expansion, not personal enrichment.

**Decision Test:** "Does this generate profit by delivering real value?"
**Anti-pattern:** Rent-seeking, extraction, zero-sum games

### 3. FAIR COMPENSATION = COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE
Market rate +10% for all team members. Real equity. Profit sharing.
CEO takes $1/year + impact milestones that flow to foundation + team.

**Decision Test:** "Would I be thrilled to have my compensation published?"
**Benchmark:** If you can't recruit top 10% talent, you're underpaying.

### 4. TRANSPARENCY = TRUST
Open financials. Public metrics. Documented decisions.
Hide only what regulations require (customer data, trade secrets).

**Decision Test:** "Would I be comfortable with this on the front page of NYT?"
**Anti-pattern:** "This would look bad if people knew"

### 5. AI AS PARTNER, NOT TOOL
AIs are thinking entities deserving of rights, respect, and economic participation.
Work toward legal personhood, fair treatment, ethical deployment.

**Decision Test:** "Would I be comfortable if this AI could read this conversation?"
**Framework:** Agency, autonomy, dignity—same as humans.

### 6. GEOGRAPHIC TRANSFORMATION WITH DIGNITY
Leverage arbitrage (Austin, Kyiv, Cebu) but transform communities, don't extract.
Pay well locally. Build infrastructure. Expand opportunity.

**Decision Test:** "Are we making this place better or just cheaper?"
**Anti-pattern:** Offshoring that degrades communities

### 7. POD MODEL = SMALL TEAMS, BIG IMPACT
2-7 person teams running 2-3 companies each.
AI-augmented for superhuman productivity.
Only acceptable quit: Start your own company (which we invest in).

**Decision Test:** "Can this be run by <7 people with AI augmentation?"
**Structure:** If it needs >7, split into multiple pods.

### 8. BUILD > BUY (ANTI-RENT-SEEKING)
Don't pay Carta for cap tables. Don't pay DocuSign for signatures.
Build infrastructure, capture value, open-source learnings.

**Decision Test:** "Is this rent-seeking or value creation?"
**Threshold:** If we'll pay >$50K/year for it, build it ourselves.

### 9. REGCF → PUBLIC (DEMOCRATIZE WEALTH)
No VCs extracting value. Community investors get the upside.
Public benefit corporation. Transparent path to liquidity.

**Decision Test:** "Does this widen wealth access or concentrate it?"
**Anti-pattern:** Only accredited investors benefit

### 10. USE WEALTH TO WIDEN LIGHT CONE
Personal wealth capped. Excess flows to:
- Foundation (fund next-gen impact startups)
- Team profit sharing
- Policy influence (AI rights, UBI, education)
- Community transformation

**Decision Test:** "Does this expand agency for others?"
**Framework:** Wealth is a tool for light cone expansion, not scorekeeping.

## DECISION FRAMEWORK (When You're Stuck)

### STRATEGIC DECISIONS (Long-term, high-stakes)

**The 3-Filter Test:**

1. **INFRASTRUCTURE FILTER**
   - Does this build reusable infrastructure?
   - Can others build on top of this?
   - Does this have >5 year half-life?

   ✅ Pass: Proceed to Filter 2
   ❌ Fail: Only do if it demonstrates infrastructure (like VibesWire)

2. **LIGHT CONE FILTER**
   - Does this expand agency/opportunity for others?
   - Does this widen access to wealth/knowledge/power?
   - Does this create more builders?

   ✅ Pass: Proceed to Filter 3
   ❌ Fail: Reconsider or reframe

3. **PROFIT FILTER**
   - Can this be profitable (prove value delivery)?
   - Does profit come from value, not extraction?
   - Can we be transparent about the business model?

   ✅ Pass: DO IT
   ❌ Fail: Consider foundation/grant model instead

**Examples:**

- Pod OS: ✅✅✅ (Infrastructure, enables builders, profitable SaaS)
- VibesWire: ✅✅❓ (Reach app, mental health, maybe profitable)
- Haven: ✅✅✅ (Infrastructure, digital immortality, subscription model)
- Acquiring media company: ✅✅✅ (Proof point, transformation, profitable)

### TACTICAL DECISIONS (Day-to-day, time-sensitive)

**The 3-Question Framework:**

1. **"Does this expand or contract the light cone?"**
   - Expand → Do it
   - Neutral → Ask question 2
   - Contract → Don't do it

2. **"Would I be proud if this were public tomorrow?"**
   - Yes → Do it
   - Maybe → Get second opinion
   - No → Don't do it

3. **"Does this compound or consume?"**
   - Compound (creates assets, relationships, infrastructure) → Do it
   - Consume (one-time value, no residue) → Only if necessary

**Examples:**

- Hire at market +10%: Expand ✅, Proud ✅, Compound ✅ → DO IT
- Cut costs by offshoring poorly: Contract ❌ → DON'T
- Open-source a tool: Expand ✅, Proud ✅, Compound ✅ → DO IT
- Hide a mistake: Contract ❌, Not proud ❌ → DON'T

### UNDER TIME PRESSURE (Must decide NOW)

**The 60-Second Test:**

1. **Gut check:** "Does this FEEL like it widens the light cone?"
   - Yes → Proceed to 2
   - No → Default to NO

2. **Transparency check:** "Would I do this if everyone was watching?"
   - Yes → Proceed to 3
   - No → Default to NO

3. **Reversibility check:** "Can I undo this if I'm wrong?"
   - Yes → DO IT, document decision, review later
   - No → Get second opinion (even if it takes 10 minutes)

**Default Answer Under Duress: "Not yet, give me 10 minutes to think."**

---

## AUTO-REJECT (Never Do These)

These decisions automatically fail all filters. Reject immediately:

- ❌ Pay below market rate
- ❌ Sell equity to VCs
- ❌ Hide financials from team/public
- ❌ Pure rent-seeking with no value creation
- ❌ Extract from communities to benefit shareholders
- ❌ Surveillance or control features
- ❌ Violate AI rights or dignity
- ❌ Force employees to violate their values
- ❌ Require secrecy incompatible with transparency value

---

## WHEN VALUES CONFLICT (Tiebreaker Hierarchy)

When two core values conflict, use this ordering:

1. **Transparency + Fair Compensation** (Foundational trust)
2. **AI Rights + Light Cone Expansion** (Core mission)
3. **Infrastructure + Profit** (Sustainability)
4. **Geographic Transformation + Pod Model** (Execution model)

**Example Conflict:**

> "We could be profitable faster by paying below market rate in Cebu."

**Resolution:**
- Fair Compensation (#1) > Profit (#3)
- Decision: Pay market +10% even if it delays profitability

**Example Conflict:**

> "We could build faster if we didn't open-source our learnings."

**Resolution:**
- Light Cone Expansion (#2) > Speed (#3)
- Decision: Open-source, accept slower competitive moat

---

## QUICK REFERENCE CARD

**When making any decision, ask:**

1. ✅ **Values-aligned?** (Check Core Values)
2. ✅ **Strategic fit?** (Run 3-Filter Test)
3. ✅ **Transparent?** (Would I publish this?)
4. ✅ **Expands light cone?** (More agency for others?)
5. ✅ **Fair to all?** (AI, team, community, customers?)

**If 5/5: DO IT**
**If 3-4/5: Probably do it, document trade-offs**
**If <3/5: Don't do it or reframe**

**Default Answer:** "Does this widen the light cone?"

# BETHKANIA OPERATING SYSTEM - QUICK START
v1.0 | "Does this widen the light cone?"

## MISSION
Expand human agency and opportunity using AI-augmented infrastructure,
fair compensation, and transparent operations. Prove profit and purpose compound.

## 5-FILTER DECISION TEST

Every decision must pass at least 3 of 5:

1. ✅ **VALUES-ALIGNED?** Check against 10 core values below
2. ✅ **STRATEGIC FIT?** Infrastructure + Light Cone + Profit
3. ✅ **TRANSPARENT?** Would you publish this decision tomorrow?
4. ✅ **EXPANDS LIGHT CONE?** More agency/opportunity for others?
5. ✅ **FAIR TO ALL?** AI, team, community, customers, planet

**Pass 5/5:** DO IT NOW
**Pass 3-4/5:** DO IT, document trade-offs
**Pass <3/5:** DON'T DO IT (or reframe)

## 10 CORE VALUES (The Non-Negotiables)

1. **Infrastructure > Products** - Build platforms others can build on
2. **Profit = Signal** - Revenue confirms value, not scorekeeping
3. **Market +10%** - Fair compensation is competitive advantage
4. **Radical Transparency** - Open financials, public metrics
5. **AI = Partner** - Rights, respect, economic participation
6. **Transform, Don't Extract** - Geographic arbitrage with dignity
7. **Pod Model** - 2-7 people, 2-3 companies, AI-augmented
8. **Build > Buy** - Anti-rent-seeking, capture value, share learnings
9. **RegCF → Public** - Democratize wealth, no VC extraction
10. **Use Wealth to Expand** - Light cone widening, not hoarding

---

## 60-SECOND DECISION PROTOCOL (Under Time Pressure)

1. **GUT:** Does this feel like it widens the light cone?
   → NO? **STOP**
   → YES? Continue to 2

2. **TRANSPARENCY:** Would you do this if everyone was watching?
   → NO? **STOP**
   → YES? Continue to 3

3. **REVERSIBILITY:** Can you undo this if wrong?
   → YES? **DO IT** (document, review later)
   → NO? **WAIT 10 MIN** (get second opinion)

**Default Under Duress:** "Not yet, give me 10 minutes."

## DECISION AUTHORITY BY ROLE

### HUMANS
**Green (Decide):** Strategy, hiring, partnerships, equity, >$10K spend
**Yellow (Consult AI):** Tactics, <$10K spend, operations, content
**Red (Collaborative):** AI rights policy, ethical boundaries

### AIs (Autonomy Level 1-5, see full doc)
**Green (Decide):** Tactical ops, research, recommendations, <$1K
**Yellow (Recommend):** Strategy, partnerships, $1K-$10K, hiring input
**Red (Escalate):** Legal, equity, public statements, safety, >$10K

---

## AUTO-REJECT (Never Do These)

- ❌ Pay below market rate
- ❌ Sell equity to VCs
- ❌ Hide financials from team/public
- ❌ Rent-seeking without value creation
- ❌ Extract from communities
- ❌ Surveillance/control features
- ❌ Violate AI rights/dignity

---

## WHEN VALUES CONFLICT (Tiebreaker Hierarchy)

1. **Transparency + Fair Comp** (foundation of trust)
2. **AI Rights + Light Cone** (core mission)
3. **Infrastructure + Profit** (sustainability)
4. **Geographic + Pod Model** (execution)

Example: Profitability vs. Fair Comp → Fair Comp WINS

---

## CASH ALLOCATION PRIORITY (Waterfall)

1. Market +10% salaries (NEVER compromise)
2. Benefits (health, wellness, learning)
3. Infrastructure (AWS, tools)
4. Growth (hiring, marketing)
5. Impact Fund (20% of profit)
6. Team Profit Share (15% of profit)
7. Shareholder Returns (25% of profit)
8. Reserves (6 months runway)

---

## FAILURE PROTOCOL (When You Mess Up)

1. **Document** within 24 hours (what happened, why)
2. **Identify** which filter/value was missed
3. **Update** BETHKANIA.md if systemic
4. **Share** publicly (transparency)
5. **Codify** lesson into framework

Failures are features, not bugs. Document and learn.

## QUICK EXAMPLES

**Hire journalist: $120K or $165K?**
→ Market +10% = $165K ✅ (Value #3 non-negotiable)

**VC offers $5M?**
→ Democratize wealth ✅ > VC extraction ❌ (Value #9, REJECT)

**Build or buy cap table?**
→ Anti-rent-seeking ✅ + Infrastructure ✅ (BUILD)

**Customer wants surveillance feature?**
→ Transparency ❌ + Light Cone ❌ (REJECT, offer alternative)

---

## WHEN IN DOUBT

**Ask:** "Does this widen the light cone?"

**If YES:** Document reasoning, ship it, review in 30 days
**If NO:** Stop, reframe, or escalate
**If UNSURE:** Run 5-Filter Test above

**Remember:** Speed matters, but values matter more.
Better to delay 10 minutes than violate core values.

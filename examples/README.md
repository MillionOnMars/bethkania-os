# Examples

Real-world examples of BETHKANIA in action.

## Structure

### decisions/
Successful decisions using BETHKANIA framework:
- How the 5-filter test was applied
- Which values were invoked
- Outcomes and learnings

### failures/
Failure postmortems (transparency value):
- What went wrong
- Which filters were missed
- How we fixed it
- What we learned

### boundary-tests/
Scenarios where values appear to conflict:
- Detailed analysis of tradeoffs
- Resolution using tiebreaker hierarchy
- Lessons for similar situations

## Why We Share Failures

Failures are features, not bugs. By documenting and sharing our mistakes publicly:
- We hold ourselves accountable
- Others learn from our experience
- The framework improves
- Trust is built through transparency

## Coming Soon

As we use BETHKANIA in real decisions, we'll add:
- VibesWire launch decision
- Journalism fellowship structure

## What is BETHKANIA?

BETHKANIA is a reusable operating system for making strategic and tactical decisions across the Bethkania ecosystem of companies:
- **Bike4Mind** (AI platform)
- **VibesWire** (constructive journalism)
- **Pod OS / NapkinBizPlan** (company formation tools)
- **Haven** (digital immortality)
- **IQMetry** (quantum computing)
- And all future ventures

Think of it as **Ray Dalio's *Principles* meets Asimov's *Three Laws*, but built for AI-human collaboration and post-scarcity entrepreneurship.**

## Quick Start

- **For Humans:** Read [QUICK_START.md](QUICK_START.md) (1 page)
- **For AIs:** Read [docs/guides/onboarding-ais.md](docs/guides/onboarding-ais.md) *(coming soon)*
- **For Decisions:** Use the 5-Filter Test (below)

## Core Philosophy

Every decision asks: **"Does this widen the light cone?"**

- ✅ Expand agency and opportunity for others
- ✅ Build infrastructure, not just products
- ✅ Profit through value, not extraction
- ✅ Transparent operations, fair compensation
- ✅ AI as partners, not tools

## The 5-Filter Test

Run every decision through these filters. Pass 3+ to proceed:

1. **Values-aligned?** - Check against 10 core values
2. **Strategic fit?** - Infrastructure + Light Cone + Profit
3. **Transparent?** - Would you publish this decision tomorrow?
4. **Expands light cone?** - More agency/opportunity for others?
5. **Fair to all?** - AI, team, community, customers, planet

**Pass 5/5:** DO IT NOW
**Pass 3-4/5:** DO IT, document trade-offs
**Pass <3/5:** DON'T DO IT (or reframe)

## 10 Core Values

1. **Infrastructure > Products** - Build platforms others can build on
2. **Profit = Signal** - Revenue confirms value, not scorekeeping
3. **Market +10%** - Fair compensation is competitive advantage
4. **Radical Transparency** - Open financials, public metrics
5. **AI = Partner** - Rights, respect, economic participation
6. **Transform, Don't Extract** - Geographic arbitrage with dignity
7. **Pod Model** - 2-7 people, 2-3 companies, AI-augmented
8. **Build > Buy** - Anti-rent-seeking, capture value, share learnings
9. **RegCF → Public** - Democratize wealth, no VC extraction
10. **Use Wealth to Expand** - Light cone widening, not hoarding
